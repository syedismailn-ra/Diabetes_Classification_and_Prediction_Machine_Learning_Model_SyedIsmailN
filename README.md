**Diabetes_Classification_and_Prediction_Machine_Learning_Model_SyedIsmailN**

This project is an end-to-end machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on user-provided health data. The project demonstrates the full machine learning pipeline from data gathering to creating a prediction model. 

**Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to create a seamless process for predicting diabetes by building a machine learning model that analyzes various health parameters.

**Project Objectives**
The project follows these key steps:

1. Data Gathering: Collected relevant medical data from various sources, including public datasets.
2. Descriptive Analysis: Explored the dataset to understand the underlying patterns and trends.
3. Data Visualizations: Created insightful visualizations to represent key relationships in the data.
4. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and transformed the data for use in the machine learning model.
5. Data Modelling: Trained a machine learning model using scikit-learn to predict diabetes.
6. Model Evaluation: Assessed the model's performance using various metrics to ensure accuracy.

**Technical Aspects**
**Machine Learning Model**
- Library: scikit-learn
- Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests
  
- Input Features: The following fields are taken from the user:
  - Number of Pregnancies
  - Insulin Level
  - Age
  - Body Mass Index (BMI)
  - Blood Pressure
  - Glucose Level
  - Skin Thickness
  - Diabetes Pedigree Function
    
- Output: The model predicts whether the person is likely to have diabetes (Yes/No).

**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.13
- scikit-learn
- Pandas


**Data Analysis Key Findings**
•	Zero values in 'Glucose', 'BloodPressure', 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin', and 'BMI' were treated as missing values and replaced with NaN, then imputed with the mean (for 'Glucose' and 'BloodPressure') or median (for 'SkinThickness', 'Insulin', and 'BMI') based on their distributions.

•	Data was split into training and testing sets (X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test) to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

•	Feature scaling using StandardScaler was applied to standardize the range of input features, which is important for many machine learning algorithms.

•	GridSearchCV with ShuffleSplit cross-validation was used to find the best model and hyperparameters among Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and SVM.

•	Random Forest was selected as the best model based on achieving the highest cross-validation score.

•	The Random Forest model achieved a high accuracy of approximately 99.94% on the training set and 98.75% on the test set.

•	Evaluation using a confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report showed strong performance, although a slight difference between training and test accuracy (~1.19%) suggests potential minor overfitting.

•	A function was created to make predictions on new patient data, which includes converting input to appropriate data types, structuring it correctly, scaling it using the same fitted StandardScaler, and using the trained classifier to predict the outcome.

**Conclusion**
This project aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. Through a comprehensive process involving data loading, cleaning (handling missing values by imputation), exploration, model building, and rigorous evaluation, we identified Random Forest as the most accurate algorithm for this dataset. The model achieved a high accuracy of approximately 98.75% on unseen test data, demonstrating its strong predictive capability. This high performance suggests that the features included in the dataset are highly relevant for identifying individuals at risk of diabetes. The potential implications of this project include the use of such a model as a preliminary screening tool to help identify individuals who may benefit from further medical evaluation. However, it is crucial to reiterate that this model is not a substitute for professional medical diagnosis or advice. Ultimately, while predictive models can be valuable tools, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including balanced nutrition, regular physical activity, and proactive health management, remains the cornerstone of preventing and managing diabetes and improving overall well-being.
